    <h1 style="font-size:60px;"> Application Overview </h1>
    <p> This application will follow the traditional style of hangman. 
        This is a guessing game played with two or more players, with a limited
        number of guesses. One player would pick a word, and the other player(s) 
        try to guess the word letter by letter. Each letter a player gets wrong, 
        a body part is added to the "hangman" until the player runs out of guesses 
        when the "hangman" is completed.
    </p> 
    <h2 style="font-size:30px;"> Technology Overview </h2>
    <p> I will use python to complete this project. </p>

    <p> 25 March 2022 </p>
    <h2 style="font-size:30px;"> Feature List </h2>
    <p> <ul>
        <li> The player will be given up to two hints at the beginning of the game
            to help them guess the word. </li>
        <li> The player's chances will decrease if they get a leader wrong (i.e.      
            adding a head to the hangman.)</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2 style="font-size:30px;"> Future Feature List </h2>
    <p> <ul> 
        <li> I would like to be able to create a program that can be played 
            multiple different times with various words. </li>
        <li> I have seen hangman made in python using the 'Tk interface.' 
            This is something that I hope to be able to implement. </li>
    </ul> </p> 
    <h2 style="font-size:30px;"> Basic Technical Features </h2>
    <p> <ul> 
        <li> Functions </li>
        <li> Loops </li>
        <li> Different variables like word, chance, failed, guess, etc. </li>
    </ul> </p>
    <h2 style="font-size:30px;"> Advanced Technical Features </h2>
    <p> <ul> 
        <li> 'Tk interface' concepts like the widgets or event loops. </li>
        <li> I would like to try to add a timer for each guess. </li>
    </ul></p>
